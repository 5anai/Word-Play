# WordPlay
This is a beginner-level word play game application developed for iOS devices using Swift, SwiftUI, and UIKit. The app provides users with an interactive learning experience focused on pangrams, anagrams, and palindromes.

## Features

1. Pangram Game: Users can play a game where they present sentences and are challenged to input pangrams (sentences containing all letters of the alphabet).
2. Anagram Game: The app presents users with a word and scrambles its letters. Users need to rearrange the letters to form a valid word, testing their anagram-solving skills.
3. Palindrome Game: Users provide a word and whether it is a palindrome is determined (a word that reads the same forwards and backwards).
4. Interactive Learning: The app provides explanations and examples for each word play concept, helping users learn and understand pangrams, anagrams, and palindromes.
